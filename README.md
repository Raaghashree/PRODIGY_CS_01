This Python program implements the Caesar Cipher, a simple encryption technique that shifts each letter in a text by a given number of positions in the alphabet. Users can choose to either encrypt or decrypt a message by specifying the shift value. The program supports both uppercase and lowercase letters while maintaining readability.
